## Features

- **Apple Pay Integration**: Process payments using Apple Pay.
- **Google Pay Integration**: Accept payments through Google Pay.
- **Samsung Pay Integration**: Handle transactions from Samsung Pay.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints for payment processing and transaction retrieval.
- **Secure Transactions**: Built with security best practices in mind.

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- MySQL or another compatible relational database
- Apple Developer Account (for Apple Pay)
- Google Developer Account (for Google Pay)
- Samsung Developer Account (for Samsung Pay)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/payment-integration.git
   cd payment-integration
   ```

2. **Set up the database**:

   Ensure you have a MySQL (or other supported) database running. Create a new database for this application.

3. **Configure the application**:

   Update the `application.yaml` file with your database credentials and payment provider details.

4. **Build the application**:

   Use Maven or Gradle to build the project:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

5. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/payment-integration-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

## Configuration

Update the `src/main/resources/application.yaml` file with your configuration:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080

spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/payment_db
    username: root
    password: root
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true

applepay:
  merchant-id: "your-apple-merchant-id"
  merchant-name: "Your Merchant Name"
  domain: "your-domain.com"

googlepay:
  merchant-id: "your-google-merchant-id"
  merchant-name: "Your Merchant Name"
  environment: "TEST"

samsungpay:
  merchant-id: "your-samsung-merchant-id"
  merchant-name: "Your Merchant Name"
  environment: "TEST"
```

Replace the placeholders (`your-apple-merchant-id`, `your-google-merchant-id`, etc.) with your actual merchant credentials.

## Usage

The application exposes several REST endpoints to handle payment processing:

### Endpoints

- **POST /api/payments/process**: Processes a payment request.

  **Parameters**:
  - `paymentToken` (String): The token received from the payment gateway.
  - `amount` (BigDecimal): The transaction amount.
  - `paymentMethod` (String): The payment method (`APPLE_PAY`, `GOOGLE_PAY`, or `SAMSUNG_PAY`).

  **Example**:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payments/process \
    -d "paymentToken=sampleToken" \
    -d "amount=10.00" \
    -d "paymentMethod=GOOGLE_PAY"
  ```

- **GET /api/payments/transaction/{id}**: Retrieves transaction details by ID.

  **Example**:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8080/api/payments/transaction/1
  ```

## Testing

Use the provided test credentials and environments from Apple, Google, and Samsung for testing your integration. Ensure your backend is properly configured to handle tokens and process payments securely.

### Testing Steps

1. **Apple Pay**: Test using a real device and the Apple Pay sandbox environment.
2. **Google Pay**: Use Google Pay’s test cards and sandbox mode.
3. **Samsung Pay**: Test in the Samsung Pay sandbox environment.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that all payment tokens are validated securely.
- Implement HTTPS to secure all API endpoints.
- Follow PCI-DSS compliance guidelines if storing or handling sensitive card data.
- Utilize environment variables or secrets management for sensitive configurations.

### Additional Notes:

- **Documentation**: You may want to add more detailed documentation or comments to your codebase, especially around payment handling and security.
- **Environment Variables**: Consider using environment variables for sensitive data instead of hardcoding them in `application.yaml`.
- **Testing**: Ensure you thoroughly test each payment integration to handle various edge cases and error conditions.
  
By following this structure for your `README.md`, users and contributors will have a clear understanding of how to set up, configure, and use the application.
